Domino is a distributed transaction processing system implemented of SSCC (originally called SUCC). SSCC (Stateful and Stateless update Concurrency Control) is a distributed transaction control model. SSCC 1) largely removes the conflict detection; 2) does not require rollback; 3) assists the failed commit/forward to finish. These features make SSCC support high concurrency and low delay. Meanwhile, we present P4B abnormal, a new abnormal in Snapshot Isolation (SI). SSCC prevents not only all the abnormal of SI, also P4B abnormal. Domino is open source under Apache license.
